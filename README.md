# Github Year Commit
## Why?
<a href="https://github.com/robmroi03">Robmroi</a> and I asked ourselves who is more active on github since the beginning of the year.<br>
Because counting is needed when looking onto the github profile I made this to automatically count.

## Special Thanks
go out to robmroi for the idea, sallar for giving an api and to DerKalaender because you can always thank him (especially if you write this late), when you spell him "DerKalaender".
And to all people who build a library (I use).
